description: "My startup checklist"

This is the beginning of a series on trying to build a viable (profitable) startup from a side project that I have been wanting to do for a while.

This post will serve as the initial brain dump and will ultimately be a table of contents for future blog posts on each step that I go through in order to serve as a guide for others that want to learn from my many mistakes that I'm sure I will make. Also, at any point of failure I hope to learn from my mistakes and try again and in doing so I will also update the blog series with the failure, cause and resolution to hopefully prevent that same mistake in the future.

This is very much a work in progress and will change frequently until I figure out what exactly I need to do and in what order :). Use at your own risk!
