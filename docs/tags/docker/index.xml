      <description>Goal In a previous blog post I setup a docker swarm cluster. Now I want a way to visualize what the swarm cluster looks like. How many nodes I have and which containers are running. Also as I change the state of the swarm cluster through docker commands I&amp;rsquo;d like to visualize what is actually happening.
The solution There is a docker image named dockersamples/visualizer that will give you a url that you can go to in order to view your swarm cluster.</description>

      <description>Overview I&amp;rsquo;m learning docker swarm mode and need a realistic simulation of setting up a multi-node cluster. Azure is an ideal platform to test things out. My goal is to create a docker swarm cluster within a single region. Creating a multi-region swarm cluster requires creating virutal networks in different regions and connecting those vnets through a vpn gateway which is not something I&amp;rsquo;m ready to tackle just yet.</description>
