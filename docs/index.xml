      <description>This is the beginning of a series on trying to build a viable (profitable) startup from a side project that I have been wanting to do for a while.
This post will serve as the initial brain dump and will ultimately be a table of contents for future blog posts on each step that I go through in order to serve as a guide for others that want to learn from my many mistakes that I&amp;rsquo;m sure I will make.</description>

      <description>As part of a continuous integration pipeline I&amp;rsquo;m running my Postman api tests after every deployment to our development environment via TeamCity and Newman. One issue that I encountered was that the TeamCity agent build log wasn&amp;rsquo;t showing formatted newman output correctly because by default it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show UTF8. In order to fix this you just have to update your C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\conf\buildAgent.properties file to include
teamcity.runner.commandline.stdstreams.encoding=UTF-8  and then restart the TeamCity Agent service.</description>
