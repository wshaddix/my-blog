      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m learning docker swarm mode and need a realistic simulation of setting up a multi-node cluster. Azure is an ideal platform to test things out. My goal is to create a docker swarm cluster within a single region. Creating a multi-region swarm cluster requires creating virutal networks in different regions and connecting those vnets through a vpn gateway which is not something I&amp;rsquo;m ready to tackle just yet.
My Setup I&amp;rsquo;m running a windows 10 workstation with docker for windows.</description>

      <description>As part of a continuous integration pipeline I&amp;rsquo;m running my Postman api tests after every deployment to our development environment via TeamCity and Newman. One issue that I encountered was that the TeamCity agent build log wasn&amp;rsquo;t showing formatted newman output correctly because by default it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show UTF8. In order to fix this you just have to update your C:\TeamCity\buildAgent\conf\buildAgent.properties file to include
teamcity.runner.commandline.stdstreams.encoding=UTF-8 and then restart the TeamCity Agent service.</description>
